        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>6 small potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>7 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>⅔ pound leftover cooked ham, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. <br>Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). <br>Grease a 1 1/2-quart baking dish.</li>
            <li>When the potatoes are almost finished, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. <br>Add ham and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. <br>Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Drain potatoes; add to the ham mixture and stir to combine. <br>Transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. <br>Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Gradually whisk milk into the flour mixture; season with salt and black pepper. <br>Continue cooking and stirring until thickened, about 2 minutes. <br>Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in Cheddar cheese until melted.</li>
            <li>Pour cheese sauce over ham and potatoes. <br>Sprinkle bread crumbs over top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and browned, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
