# odin-recipes
This is an introductory/beginner html project that focuses on implementing elemental and fondamental building blocks of most web pages such as text tags, links and images, ordered lists and unordered lists.
Practicing commiting messages while advancing on the tasks isn't necessary but can help for the long run, it's a good habit to start working on.
The idea was to code an index page containing some recipes. Each recipe is a link to another web page containg more data about the recipe: a description of the recipe, an image of the dish, ingredients and common directions for fellow cooks.
